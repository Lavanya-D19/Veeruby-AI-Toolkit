# ⚡ Veeruby AI Tools Reference

Welcome to the **Veeruby AI Tools Reference Repository** 🎯  
This is the **official internal AI tool guide** for Veeruby employees.  

It helps every department quickly find the **best 1–2 AI tools** for their daily work:  
- ✅ **Free tools first** (whenever available and reliable)  
- 💎 **Paid tools only if worth it** (best-in-class, subscription justified)  

No long lists. No trial-and-error. Just **clear, practical choices**.

## 📌 How to Use
1. Browse the `departments/` folder.  
2. Open your department folder (e.g., `marketing/`, `sales/`).  
3. Inside, check `README.md` → you’ll find a simple table of **Use Case → Tool → Link → Free/Paid**.
